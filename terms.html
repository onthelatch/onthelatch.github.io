        </div>

        <p class="section-intro">Welcome to On the Latch. These Terms of Service ("<strong>Terms</strong>") govern your access to and use of our website, located at <a href="onthelatch.github.io" target="_blank">onthelatch.github.io</a> (the "<strong>Website</strong>"), and the purchase of licenses for our software applications (our "<strong>Services</strong>"). These Terms are a binding legal agreement between the business entity you represent or are employed by ("<strong>Customer</strong>," "<strong>you</strong>," "<strong>your</strong>") and Alex Doble, doing business as On the Latch ("<strong>Company</strong>," "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>," or "<strong>our</strong>"). By accessing our Website or purchasing a license, you agree to be bound by these Terms, our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, and our <a href="eula.html">End-User License Agreement (EULA)</a>. If you do not agree to all of these terms, you may not use our Website or Services.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
            <p>The Company provides the "Ticket Scanner" mobile application (the "<strong>App</strong>"), a tool designed to work with the Spektrix‚Ñ¢ box office service. Our Service consists of providing you with a license to use this App, managed through a recurring subscription model.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. License Purchases and Subscriptions</h2>
            <h3>a) Subscription</h3>
            <p>Your license to use the App is purchased as a recurring monthly subscription. By purchasing a subscription, you authorize us to charge your chosen payment method on a recurring monthly basis until the subscription is canceled by you or terminated by us.</p>
            
            <h3>b) Billing Cycle</h3>
            <p>Your first subscription fee will be charged on the date you complete your purchase. Subsequent fees will be charged on the same date each month thereafter (the "<strong>Billing Date</strong>").</p>
            
            <h3>c) Payment Processing</h3>
            <p>We use <strong>Paddle.com</strong> ("Paddle") as our merchant of record and payment processor. When you provide payment information, you are providing it directly to Paddle, and your purchase is subject to Paddle's own terms and privacy policy. We do not store your full credit card information.</p>
            
            <h3>d) Automatic Renewal and Cancellation</h3>
            <p>Your subscription will automatically renew each month. You may cancel your subscription at any time through the customer portal link provided in your original purchase receipt from Paddle, or by contacting us directly. <strong>To avoid being charged for the next month's subscription fee, you must cancel at least twenty-four (24) hours before your next Billing Date.</strong> Upon cancellation, your license to use the App will remain active until the end of your current paid billing period.</p>
            
            <h3>e) Price Changes</h3>
            <p>We reserve the right to change the price of our subscription plans. We will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any price changes, typically at least 30 days. If you do not agree to the price change, you must cancel your subscription before it takes effect.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Refund Policy</h2>
            <p>Due to the digital nature of our product, <strong>all sales are final</strong>. We do not offer refunds or credits for partially used subscription periods, or for periods where the license was active but unused. We encourage you to fully evaluate the App's functionality before purchasing a license. In rare circumstances, and at our sole discretion, we may consider a refund on a case-by-case basis.</p>
